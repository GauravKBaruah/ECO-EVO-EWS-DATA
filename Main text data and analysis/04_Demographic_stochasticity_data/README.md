In this folder there are three R scripts and loads of data for different **demographic Stochasticity.** Specifically **“Demographic_stochasticity_genetic_variation.RData”** is a data file containing Kendall’s tau value of abundance and trait-based EWSs for different levels of genetic variation. All you need is to use those data for plotting with R script **“plotting_demographic_stochasticity_Vs_no_stochasticity.R”** script.Make sure when you run the scripts, there are sourced R scripts from other folders , and they need to be provided with the correct directory path.1. *‘plotting_demographic_stochasticity_Vs_no_stochasticity.R’* is for plotting abundance and trait-based EWS alongside.2. *‘trait_ews_demog_Stochasticity.R’* is for abundance and trait-based ews analysis for demographic stochasticity. 3. *‘EWS_Code_demo_stochasticity.R’* is the simulation code for population collapse specifically for demographic noise in R0.
