In this folder there are three R scripts and loads of data for residual phenotypic variance.Specifically **“genvar_residuals.RData”, “plasticity_residuals.RData”, “reproductive_rate_residuals.RData”**, are data files containing Kendall’s tau value of abundance and trait-based EWSs for residual phenotypic variation. All you need is to use those data for plotting with R script **“EWS_plots_with_Wout_residuals.R”** script.Make sure when you run the scripts, there are sourced R scripts from other folders , and they need to be provided with the correct directory path.1. *EWS_plots_with_Wout_residuals.R’* is for plotting abundance and trait-based EWS alongside.2. *‘trait_EWS_phenotypic_resids.R’* is for abundance and trait-based ews analysis for residual phenotypic variance.3. *‘EWS_Code_phenotypoc_noise.R’* is the simulation code for population collapse specifically for residual phenotypic variance.
