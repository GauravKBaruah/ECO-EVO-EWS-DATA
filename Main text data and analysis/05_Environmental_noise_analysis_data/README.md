**In this folder there are four R scripts and loads of data for different noise levels.**1. *Ôhigh_noise_ews_analysis.RÕ* is for ews analysis for high environmental noise.2. *Ôlow_noise_ews.RÕ* is for low environmental noise.3. *ÔNoise_trait_ews_plots.RÕ* is for plotting abundance and trait based EWS together for the different levels of environmental noise.4. *ÔEWS_Code_environmental_stochasticity.RÕ* is the simulation code for population collapse specifically for environmental noise.
